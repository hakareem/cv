# CV
While attempting to improve my knowledge of forms by getting values from input boxes I thought it would also be a good opportunity to build a cv builder using Javascript. The clear inputs, outputs and styling of this project means that they have been a perfect exercise for improving my knowledge of HTML & CSS & Javascript. I've also been able to learn some really nice and efficient ways of writing short and consice code.

# Learning Experience
It was a valuable learning experience. I got to experiement with the DOM using Javascript. I discovered new ways of writing more concise and cleaner code that is easy to understand. 

# Areas For Improvment 
This form can certainly be improved. <br>
• I should allow the user to customise fonts and styles of the CV. <br>
• I can also improve this project by enabling an option for uploading an image.<br>
• Allow customisable page structure / layout
