# CV
While attempting to improve my knowledge of forms by getting values from input boxes I thought it would also be a good opportunity to build a cv builder using Javascript. The clear inputs, outputs and styling of this project means that they have been a perfect exercise for improving my knowledge of HTML & CSS & Javascript. I've also been able to learn some really nice and efficient ways of writing short and consice code.

# Areas For Improvment 
This form can certainly be improved. I should allow the user to customise fonts and styles of the CV. I can also improve this by enabling an option for uploading an image.
